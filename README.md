# Sound Event Classification Research


<h4>Research project code and scripts I've worked on over the past year and a half. Includes action label data, siamese models, and submitted research paper to ICASSP.</h4>




Scripts and crowdsourced data released in November. Research paper currently available for viewing.


<strong>Skills Learned</strong>
* AWS EC2 and Instance creation
* Amazon MTurk crowdsourcing platform
* Creating custom layers in Tensorflow
* Environment isolation using Anaconda


<strong>Concepts Used and Applied</strong>
* Transfer Learning using Open L3 Audio Embeddings (feature extraction)
* Siamese Network architecture (shared base network)
* Normalization & Scaling raw non-vector data
* Multi-Task ML networks (multi-heads & multi-inputs)
* Feature extractor using MLP layered on top of SVM
* Benefits + Cons of activation functions & losses in NN
* Early Stopping techniques and overfitting reduction
* Convolutional NN on spectrogram images
* Fold isolation and test/train/validation split
* Managing class imbalances
* Forcing network to learn shared features through multiple output types
* Combination of several loss functions
